<h1>Best Films of All Time (Undisputable)</h1>
<h2>What Dingo Says, Goes. His Taste > All.</h2>

<h3>Children of Men</h3>
<p>A 2nd coming of Christ allegory amidst a dytoptic future that has sucked the optimism and hope out of its inhabitants, and how life itself can possibly revert that, makes this Ding's personal fave Christmas Moobie.</p>


<h3>Babel</h3>
<p>Utilizing four shifting perspectives, this film most effectively captures the danger, and necessity, of communication.</p>


<h3>Birdman</h3>
<p>One of the first films to attempt the "all-in-one-take" tricks, Alejandro Innaritu plays with the audience's perspective of real and fiction while balancing a tight script about existentialism, the stagnation of art as time moves onward, and the "need" to produce art that's meaningful in an increasingly cynical and capitalist driven industry.</p>

<h3>Honorable Mention: King Kong (1931)</h3>
<p>For some it's Citizen Kane, but for me it was this film that cemented the inginuity and craft of the industry as the first true visual effects driven adventure/action film with stand out stop motion effects that shaped the entirety of the Hollywood industry to this day. From equivalents like Godzilla, modern examples like Transformers/Avengers, or even the more somber visual effects driven affair like BladeRunner 2049, much of it owes to the success of VFX driven films like King Kong.</p>
